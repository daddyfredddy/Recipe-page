          <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong></li>
            <p>
              Preheat the oven to 375°F for 30 minutes with an oven rack in the
              center position.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Prep the baking sheets:</strong></li>
            <p>
              Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set to the side.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Make the cookie dough:</strong></li>
            <p>
              Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl and
              set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter and brown
              sugar together until just combined. On medium speed, beat in the
              eggs one at a time, scraping the bowl after each addition,
              followed by the vanilla extract. The dough will be soft, but
              that’s what we want. On low speed, beat in the flour mixture all
              at once, until just combined. Mix in the chocolate chips by hand,
              or with the mixer on low speed. Transfer the dough to a piece of
              plastic wrap and form into a flat rectangle (this will help the
              dough chill faster). Wrap the plastic wrap around the dough and
              refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

            <li><strong>Make the brownie dough:</strong></li>
            <p>
              In a large, microwave-safe mixing bowl melt the chocolate and
              butter together in 30-second intervals, stirring between each,
              until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Whisk in
              the brown sugar, followed by the eggs and vanilla extract. Using a
              spatula, fold in the flour, sifted cocoa powder, baking powder,
              salt, and chocolate chips to form a very soft dough. Transfer the
              dough to a piece of plastic wrap and form into a flat rectangle
              (this will help the dough chill faster). Wrap the plastic wrap
              around the dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

            <p>
              nce both doughs have chilled, use a small cookie scoop to measure
              about 1 tablespoon of each dough. Using your palms, roll the two
              doughs gently together to form a ball and place on the
              parchment-lined baking sheet. Place all the dough balls on one of
              the baking sheets (it's ok to crowd them), cover with plastic
              wrap, and chill for at least 30 minutes while the oven preheats or
              up to overnight.

            <li><strong>Bake the brookies:</strong></li>
            <p>
              Rearrange the chilled cookie dough balls between two sheet pans so
              they are spaced a few inches apart. (If you have more than will
              fit comfortably, transfer the extras to a dinner plate and place
              back in the fridge). Sprinkle lightly with sea salt. Bake one
              sheet at a time for 10 to 12 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the
              sheet pan for 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool
              completely. Repeat with the remaining dough. Store the cookies in
              an airtight container on the counter. They will keep for about 3
              to 4 days before starting to dry out.
